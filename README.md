# SVSC Technical Adjunct Test
This website was built by Raymond Huang for the SIGGRAPH SVSC Technical Adjunct test.\
This page displays the public members of the [Facebook GitHub organization](https://github.com/facebook) and queries data from the [public API](https://api.github.com/orgs/facebook/public_members).\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Other scripts are also packaged with create-react-app, but unused for this assessment.

## Additional Notes

Because this is a short assessment, not authentication was used/implemented for the GitHub API. I also wrote very little CSS, since it wasn't being evaluated. I added various classnames for code readability but only added actual CSS where it affected the page's usability.
